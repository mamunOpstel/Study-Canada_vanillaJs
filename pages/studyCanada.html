                  The education system in Canada varies from province to
                  province and can be divided into four different levels –
                  pre-elementary, primary, secondary, and post-secondary.
                  Pre-elementary is the beginning of Canadian education and is
                  given to children of 4-5 years. The primary begins at the age
                  of 6-7 and goes up to 13-14. Secondary education has two
                  levels – junior high school and high school. The
                  post-secondary begins after the completion of secondary
                  education and is offered by many reputed institutes and

                <p>
                  Studying overseas isn’t cheap. It requires huge sums of money
                  to fulfill your dream of studying abroad. Luckily, Canada is
                  viewed as a cost-effective option as compared to its
                  counterparts when it comes to studying overseas. The overall
                  cost to study in Canada can be divided into various factors
                  which are discussed as under
                </p>
                <p class="small-heading color-red">Tuition fee</p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  The tuition fees can vary from university to university as
                  well as your selected study program. The estimated tuition
                  fees to pursue a course from a Canadian university ranges
                  around CAD 13,000 and CAD 35,000 per year.
                </p>
                <p class="small-heading color-red">Transportation</p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  Public transportation such as buses, taxis, trains, etc, can
                  cost you around CAD 200 to CAD 400 annually.
                </p>
                <p class="small-heading color-red">Health insurance</p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  Health insurance is mandatory to take admission in a Canadian
                  university and can cost you around CAD 840 per year.

                <p class="small-heading color-red">Accommodation</p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  Many Canadian universities provide good quality on-campus
                  accommodation costing you nearly CAD 7000 per year. If your
                  university does not provide on- campus accommodation then you
                  have to go for off-campus housing that costs around CAD 400 to
                  CAD 700 per month.
                </p>
                <p class="small-heading color-red">Other living expenses</p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  The other expenses include mobile phone, food, groceries,
                  stationery, clothes, entertainment, social activities, etc.
                  and the total cost of the same can be around CAD 10,000
                  annually.

              Currently, we can only offer domestic payment options for certain
              institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are trying to make a domestic payment (same country), and
              your country is not listed on our website, it means that we do not
              offer domestic payment options for your country or institution.

            <p class="mb-4">
              The time it takes for your payment to reach your institution can
              vary depending on the payment method.

              Bank Transfer
            </h4>
            <p>
              From the moment Flywire receives the funds from your bank, it
              usually takes 2 to 3 business days to process and deliver the
              payment to your institution. After Flywire receives your payment,
              it will automatically be guaranteed to your institution
            </p>
            <h4 class="color-red">
              <span class="red-dot"></span>
              Card or other online payment methods
            </h4>
            <p>
              If you have chosen to pay by card or other online payment methods,
              your payment is automatically guaranteed to your institution.
              Typically, funds are delivered within 2 to 3 business days after
              the payment was made.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading mb-3">
              Do you accept credit cards and debit cards?
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              At this time, we accept debit and credit card payments for certain
              institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If, when you are making your payment request, Visa, and/or
              MasterCard are listed as payment options, that means the credit
              card option is available for your payment
            </p>
            <p>
              For certain institutions and countries, we can accept additional
              card brands. Those cards’ logos will be displayed once you select
              the country when making your payment request
            </p>
            <p>
              If a card’s logo is not displayed, that means we are unable to
              accept it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading mb-3">
              Why is the amount different between payment method options?
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              If you check our rates for the bank transfer, you will notice that
              the price is lower. Because bank transfers do not involve card
              payment processors, we can provide better pricing. Select this
              option if you are looking to make a payment at the lowest cost
              available.
            </p>
            <p>
              edit card payments, on the other hand, are instantaneous and offer
              many advantages in terms of convenience and speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need to make a time-sensitive payment, then the card option
              is a great choice. We advise payers to use credit cards
              denominated in their local currency to avoid charges resulting
              from the currency conversions. If a dual or different currency
              credit card is used, the payer’s bank may charge a currency
              conversion fee to send the payment to Flywire
            </p>
